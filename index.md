Starting this October (2021) I will be a PhD Student at Imperial College London in Computer Science. I recently graduated from Imperial with a MEng in Mathematics and Computer Science.

My research interests include Î»-calculi, type theory, functional programming languages, dependent types, theorem proving and classical logic.

## Stuff I've Done

### Candid: A classical theorem prover
[Candid](https://github.com/david-davies/prover) is a functional programming language with dependent types and control operators (think call/cc from Scheme). By making certain value-like restrictions for dependent typings, it also doubles up us a theorem prover for classical (first order) logic.
