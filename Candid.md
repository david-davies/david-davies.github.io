# Candid: A Classical Theorem Prover
[Candid](https://github.com/david-davies/prover) is a functional programming language with dependent types and control operators (think call/cc from Scheme). By making certain value-like restrictions for dependent typings, it also doubles up us a theorem prover for classical (first order) logic. 

This means we can prove classical properties with computational meaning!
